# Travelling Salesman Problem on the Road Network Graph

A simple project developed as part of [Combinatorical Optimization](https://www.ua.pt/pt/uc/4480) curriculum unit where the objective was to solve a modified **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. Classicaly this problem is solved by finding the shortest possible cycle that visits a set of locations exactly once and returns to the starting point (i.e., a Hamiltonian cycle). In this modified version, the challenge was twofold: first, to determine the shortest route that visits 8 out of a given list of 10 churches in the city of Porto; and second, to solve the problem using the real-world pedestrian road network â€” yielding the following result

**OSMnx** package was used to get the locations of the churches and extract the road network [^1].

## Algorithms Used

There are various algorithmic strategies and heuristics to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), each with different trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. In this project, the following approaches were evaluated:

- Local Search
- Simulated Annealing
- Branch and Bound

## Usage

To run this project, use the conda environment defined in the `environment.yml` with

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
